# Formtastic books

This repository is for testing out formtastic, the goal is addressing accessibility

The form validations will be arbitrary, but still try to convey meaning like a real rails form.

* Ruby version 3.2.0

* Rails 8.0.2

* Database initialization

Make sure to follow these steps to get started with form locally

`bundle install`
`rails db:migrate`
`rails db:seed` # creates a book with everything intentionally invalid for testing
`rails s`, then go to `https://localhost:3000` in your browser
